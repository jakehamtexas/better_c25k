# better_c25k

## Introduction

This is an application that I am continuously developing to hone my flutter and dart skills. I have taken heavy inspiration from [ResoCoder's many tutorials](https://resocoder.com/) for stylistic decisions regarding directory structure, libraries at use, and state management patterns. His free courses are absolutely invaluable.

This application is based on my own experience with the [C25K running program](http://www.c25k.com/) and one available free [fitness trainer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.c25k&hl=en_US) that I have been using. There are some things that irk me about the unpaid-for version of this app, so rather than spend five bucks to fix that, I'd rather spend months learning a mobile development framework so I can rebuild the app myself, with some tweaks. ðŸ¥³
